  "description": "Created as a harbinger of harmony and peace in a world riddled with killing machines, Arto revolutionized the never-ending fight against evil all over the universe. With her advanced harmonizers and photonic stabilizers built into entire curation, Arto effectively absorbs the negative and deviant energy from the attacks of her adversaries, and channels it as phaser attacks that rob the enemy of the will to fight, defusing him and illustrating how peace and wellness must prevail over violence and bloodshed. For her purpose, Arto has been created using one of the finest and lightest materials to ensure a nimble flight and movement, allowing movement in close to opponents while avoiding their attacks.",
