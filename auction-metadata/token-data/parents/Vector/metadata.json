  "name": "Vector",
  "description": "Built using decades of confidential research obtained from secret ancient artifacts known to belong to a now extinct superior race, Vector is designed to eliminate her opponents with ruthless and merciless efficiency. With the abilities to analyze her opponents to their bone and read their attack patterns and emotions from their minds, Vector remains a formidable opponent to anyone that approaches her, and immeasurably deadly to anyone that might not anticipate her lethal capabilities. Using advanced phaser-based pupils, she can hypnotize and paralyze her opponents, locking them in an unbreakable trance. The energy that manages to reach her is effectively absorbed within the curation and can be dispensed at will to eliminate the toughest of enemies.",
