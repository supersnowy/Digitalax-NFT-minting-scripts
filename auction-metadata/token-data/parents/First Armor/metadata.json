  "name": "First Armor",
  "description": "For those who realize their internal attributes and their capabilities, metamorphosis remains the pathway to ascension and upliftment, shedding off their older coats and realizing their qualities within a newer skin, a form that reflects the freshly realized individual. Metamorphosis does not merely account for a purely ornamental change, it stands for the unlocking of newer and better abilities and skills that drastically increase the charm and appeal of the individual, illustrating not merely the acceptance and realization of the natural course of life, but its embodiment into oneâ€™s character. First Armor symbolizes the submission towards the acute existence of the phenomena of metamorphosis; the realization of the fact that we, like everything that has existed, possess the necessary will and strength to shed our empty shells and realize into a better and stronger individual.",
