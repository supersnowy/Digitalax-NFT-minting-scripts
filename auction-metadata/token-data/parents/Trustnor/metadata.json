  "description": "Unlike ARTO, who was designed to defuse perilous opponents while getting dangerously close, Trustnor was built to perform the role of a shield, a guardian that protects the innocent from the harms of war and violence. With enhanced gravity stabilizers built within the fabric, Trustnor can swiftly fly to potentially dangerous zones before putting herself in the line of fire, channeling the impact force into a versatile and impenetrable shield that protects everything around Trustnor from certain doom and destruction. In order to effectively detect dangerous situations and act accordingly, enhanced cybernetic intelligence is a critical element of Trustnorâ€™s capabilities.",
