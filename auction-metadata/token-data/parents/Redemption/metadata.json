  "description": "Once a surveyor station has been established, human colonization ships arrive within weeks to establish settlements on the uncharted lands. However, there are times where surveyor stations might go unresponsive, often destroyed and devastated by unknown threats and creatures. That is where you are sent, to recover what has been lost, and to eliminate whatever has been destroyed. You are armed to the teeth and protected by extremely durable battle-armor that can withstand intense shocks and attacks, carrying and delivering the strength and fury of human redemption within yourself with extreme prejudice.",
