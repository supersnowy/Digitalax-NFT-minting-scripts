  "description": "With her past left in the dirt, she managed to slowly rise above her criminal rivals, making her name known for her ability to hack into the strongest security networks while being ruthless with her opponents. As her name went around in the streets, she found herself surrounded by more foes than friends, leaving many humbled before her mighty skills.
