  "description": "So, we finally did it. We decided to bring some purpose to those shitcoins. There‘s a lot of shitcoins out there. We couldn’t include them all. So we took a different approach. We took the most elegant that we could find: Bitcoin Satoshi, Ripple, TRON…. oh… and we had to include fiat right? This light, loose-fitting long coat is best combined with black dress pants and a classic Oxford shoe — for the ultimate cocktail evening include cufflinks (Preferably matching and themed).",
