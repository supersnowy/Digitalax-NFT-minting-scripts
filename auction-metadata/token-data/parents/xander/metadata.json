  "description": "Lightning Network is inspired by the Bitcoin layer 2- bringing speed, scalability, privacy and granularity. The dress features a translucent representative of the high speed bidirectional payment channels, routing through a mesh like network- the translucence giving insight into the connection to on-chain transparency. \n\nThe flash of skin and shimmer from the glassy texture make an eye-catching combo-this dress is not for shying away from attention. Paired with polished full sleeved gloves and structured shoulder padding creates an overall futurist look and feel.",
