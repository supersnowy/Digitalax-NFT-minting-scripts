  "name": "Big Shot",
  "description": "Her aims have been achieved, her enemies stand defeated and the money-hoarding corporations fear her name, yet she has remained true to her cause; her crimes left to victims, her weapons no blood. In a matter of years since her escape from the orphanage, she turned into one of the most outspoken and powerful voices for the poor, converting her crimes into efforts for public welfare. She has been placed as the symbol of hope and resilience, a contrast to how she is projected by the mainstream media that is fueled by her adversaries, global corporations. However, her skills are second to none and her orders are heard all over the world as she runs the most powerful hacking syndicate known to mankind.",
