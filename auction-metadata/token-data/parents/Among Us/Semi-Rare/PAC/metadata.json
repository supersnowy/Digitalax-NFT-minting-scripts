The PAC allows the holder a unique in-game flare when competing in the esports battles. A portion of the proceeds from the PAC and DIGI Bundle sale go towards the Player Development Fund for helping Players and Creators level up from stage 0 to 1. For the Among Us Sheriff Mod launch, the PAC gives a holder a higher chance of being allocated the Imposter role.",
