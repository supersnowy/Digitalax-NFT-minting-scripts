  "description": "While there are hundreds of hackers and tens of technicians, there can only be a limited number of Master Hunters, cybernetically enhanced humans who perform the most daring and deadliest of tasks to bring the parts necessary for the cause, for the cybernetic machines that are going to break apart the corporation. You need to be mercilessly efficient as your work would take you to the dens of the beast, the massive manufacturing factories of the corporations that are guarded by thousands of armed guards and mercenaries that are on the lookout for eliminating you. However, even they fear you for the potential you have, for they are thousands but you are only one.",
