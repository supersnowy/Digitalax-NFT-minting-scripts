  "description": "Alana, the web3girl has just been born on the 21st of July 2021. Her desires to explore the boundaries of the metaverse are seemingly endless. Alana x To the mind that is still offers a glimpse into her world through a tiny window, during her illuminating connection with her binary base code. This piece belongs to a continuing series of works that accompany Alana on her travels through different realms of the metaverse and show her understanding and appreciation of her surroundings. To the mind that is still, the whole universe surrenders (Lao Tzu, Chinese philosopher). Collaboration between Stella Achenbach and Alyona Briukhanova.",
