  "description": "What’s a cryptographic access badge without gear to match? A POAP is a digital collectible created as a NFT (non-fungible token) powered by the blockchain. Each time they take part on an event, POAP collectors get a unique badge that is supported by a cryptographic record. This fashion isn’t just ordinary fashion. It onboards you into an entire world of NFTs, Decentralized Finance, Crypto and Web3. Every fashion piece is a unique NFT that can also earn you yield in $MONA token and other crypto. We are melting the centralized exploitative crown to weave the fabric of a generative ecosystem.",
