  "description": "Using enhanced nano-technology that was designed to create military space vessels, special cybernetic robots were created to take fighting crime to the next level; enhancing law enforcement and bringing peace to the world. Traqess was the product of decades of secret research, providing a wide assortment of cyber-suits that can transform the wearers into practical superheroes, all equipped to fight crimes. The current model, curated with titanium-based reflectors, allows the users to augment the light around them, turning invisible at will. At the same time, it also offers a wide range of stealth features including barely audience movement, silenced wrist fitted guns capable of firing tranquilizer darts, and the ability to jump to over 15ft in height.",
