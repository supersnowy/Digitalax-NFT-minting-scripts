  "description": "Ø Libery Ø is about the power of creativity and thinking outside the box.  It takes a creative mind and big imagination to see the Statue of liberty holding balloons and blowing bubble gum while flying up into the clouds.  With words literally coming out of the box, this bird is flying solo because an eagle wasn't born to be part of a flock, it was born to stand out.  Inspired by web3 and NFTs, this shirt was designed to empower people to embrace their childhood imagination and create something innovative and beautiful! Physical item included!",
