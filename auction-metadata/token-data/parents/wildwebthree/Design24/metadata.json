  "name": "The Pearl of Gjoll",
  "description": "She’s the last ruler of the river Gjoll, which separates two worlds - the living and the dead. As her Nordic alter-ego, she’s the last standing between digital and physical worlds. To pass the digital boarder she asks for a gift. And every living creature, who wants to cross the metaverse boarder should find a rare iridescent pearl to please the ruler. Once she’s totally covered in pearls, she’ll turn into a metaverse spirit and release the way to all the willing.",
