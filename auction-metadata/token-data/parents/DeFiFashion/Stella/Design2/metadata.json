  "description": "Alana is a recently born digital avatar. On the 21st of July, her pixels first touched ground in the Metaverse. Her drive to explore the world and gather a better understanding of her surroundings is sheer endless. This specific piece represents her attitude towards the world as it is. With a continuing series of art pieces and collaborations, we will see if her future ideas will gravely differ from the ones she carried on her birth date: Punk is not dead … it changed its platform.",
