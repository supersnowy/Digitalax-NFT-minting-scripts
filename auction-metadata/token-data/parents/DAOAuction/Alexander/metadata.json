  "description": "The world of the future has many opportunities, but also many dangers. People are surrounded by new technology - an eye for an eye from MindBook corporation. It has replaced everything from surveillance cameras to smartphones. All people are under control and all their actions are recorded in the Life Support Journal. But not all people agree with these new standards, and some of them have opened places that MindBook corporation has not yet reached. In these places (locals call them Night Clubs) chaos reigns - people dance, move and shake, do what was once the norm! There are no boring rules, no need to write reports and conduct analysis of vital functions. Here you can be who you want to be. Of course, permissiveness has a negative side, but I'll tell this story next time.",
