  "description": "Sunsets have always hypnotized me. Every time I can, wherever I am, I try to contemplate these gorgeous spectacles of light in the sky. And, amazingly, no sunset's ever the same! If you look at it every day, you'll see it's a new show of colors and patterns each day. Where I'm from, the northeast of Brazil, we've suffered a lot throughout history because of terrible droughts, poverty, and discrimination, being Sertão the Portuguese name of the region that's most affected by this. And even with all the difficulties, we're always striving! This is why we've been known as people who overcome whatever obstacles may come our way! This dress is inspired by all of this together so you know that each day, no matter the difficulties, and even if it looks the same as the others, is a new opportunity for you to create magic!",
