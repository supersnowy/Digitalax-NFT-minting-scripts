  "description": "Metamorphosis is not an instantaneous process, for the best of results are rarely achieved with seamless travels and actions. It requires a transitional phase, a moment of existence during which one carefully yet deliberately channels the energy present within to radically transform their body. In essence, the Chrysalis represents the soul of metamorphosis, accepting a hardened and protective yet restrictive exterior to emerge as within a better self, a perfect existence achieved from an abstract and temporary one. Hence, we see Chrysalis as the gradual yet critical transitional phase where one budding and nourishing interior develops itself for the realization of oneâ€™s legacy under a hardened and callous exterior, a contrast in the physical existence of the being.",
