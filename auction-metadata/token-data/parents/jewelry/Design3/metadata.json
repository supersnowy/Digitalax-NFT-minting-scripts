  "name": "Crimes Against Nature Brooch",
  "description": "This is the 3D version of a real brooch from the archive of designer Shayli Harrison, made in collaboration with jewelery designer Sophia de Groot and manifested in virtual by Martina Ponzoni. This delicate item was part of her collection Crimes Against Nature, inspired by the “Ecosex Manifesto” by Annie Sprinkle and Beth Stephens. Ecosexuality is about seeing nature as your significant other, a relationship that comes with all the nuances of human relationships. It can be observed as romantic and reciprocal, emotional and abusive… A lens in which to view your own exchange that evokes empathy and connection to our natural world. In this way, perhaps we will be less destructive. This exclusive piece is designed as a badge to wear as part of the ecosexual revolution, fighting crimes against nature with acts against human (civilized) nature. On the body it moves like a backyard wind-chime, combining all the kinkiness of hard metals, ball-bearings and chains with the flutter of leaf-like sequins and jewels.",
