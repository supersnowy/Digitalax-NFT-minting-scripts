  "name": "Phygital Sharps Sunglasses. Physical Sunglasses Included!",
  "description": "These sunglasses are modeled by Martina Ponzoni from the archive of designer Shayli Harrison’s Sharps collection, which was inspired by a subculture known as Sharpies or Sharps that emerged out of Australia during the late sixties. In her collection, Harrison developed a character that reflected this early punk movement and the original artwork is seen in the background. The eyes of this illustration influenced the unique shape of these frames, which are coated in 14 karat gold and house a two-tone aviator lens. In this “phygital” sale you will receive both the URL item inclusive of source files alongside the IRL sunglasses with a soft carry case. Of these glasses there were only 8 created in collaboration with Metzler International, and none have been publicly distributed until now. They are truly a special collectors item.
