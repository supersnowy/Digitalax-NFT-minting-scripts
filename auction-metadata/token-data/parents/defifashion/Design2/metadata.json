  "description": "There is a certain group of people in the world of the future. They call themselves Meta Teachers. What are they doing? Nobody knows. What are they needed for? There is no answer to this question. Meta teachers are always in the spotlight, on magazine covers, on TV shows, in advertisements. It seems to many that they collect dirt on powerful people and take advantage of it. Perhaps that is why Meta Teachers are sometimes called Instant Noodles - they very often simply evaporate and new Meta Teachers take their place.",
