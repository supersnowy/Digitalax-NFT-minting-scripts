  "description": "This is a chesterfield couch inspired outfit where the clothing is filled up with poly filling to increase dress thickness. Instead of using buttons spikes are incorporated because a chesterfield couch wouldn’t be comfortable if the buttons where replaced with spikes. This fit resembles  discomfort in your own body. Don’t see it as a negative thing, because after a while you will evolve into a butterfly and escape this spiked pupa.",
