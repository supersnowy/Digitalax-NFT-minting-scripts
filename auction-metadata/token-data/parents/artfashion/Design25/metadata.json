  "description": "A futuristic art statement; what would it look like if we were in an apocalypse but still wanted to look good? Really chunky sneakers for traversing the harsh terrain with real baggy pants and a half short half robe to later use as a robe to keep yourself warm at night. A grey t-shirt  with really big shoulders to look more intimidating to the enemy  with the skull balaclava to avoid any conflict. Clogged Mind Wanted  to mix an avant garde fashion style with an apocalyptic twist to create this fashionable monster.",
