  "description": "This outfit is an experiment on how puppets will effect a clothing piece. Stuffed cloth bones are attached to the pants to create a 3D effect. A locket as a belt buckle on the pants that is up side down unable to be opened. Chunky shoes that resemble clouds but have something industrial to them as well, and a clean jacket without the keyhole cutout.",
