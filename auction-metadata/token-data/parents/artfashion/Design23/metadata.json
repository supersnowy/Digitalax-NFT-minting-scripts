  "description": "Futuristic avant-garde, searching for streetwear in a couple of years. Gender specified clothing will no longer exist and it will be all just one big mixing pot, you wear what u like. A long  skirt over some pants combined with military grade for cargo skirts. A puffer jacket but without the normal horizontal geometric lines. And a hat to keep your head warm with a buckle and adjustable strap for further comfort.",
