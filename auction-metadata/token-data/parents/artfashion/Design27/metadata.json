  "description": "Clogged mind wanted to make the most basic and classic fit into something different, interesting. A white t-shirt and black pants are a go to fashion look, now with the added folds in the pants pinned down by buttons and the clean stitched rips in the t-shirt making a half tanktop half t-shirt and creating an abstract painting of some sorts. Clogged Mind will always use masks to focus interest on the clothing  itself instead of the model.",
