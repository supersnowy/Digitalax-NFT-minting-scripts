  "description": "Not all Cadres that venture out into the dark and empty abyss of space return home; hundreds of them are still believed to be searching the vastness of the universe to find a new home for humanity. However, for the Cadres that have gone and returned with news of potential salvation, you are sent to survey upon the uncharged worlds. With the necessary equipment and weaponry to curb potential threats and hazards, your role is pivotal to the establishment of surveyor stations that inspect the newly discovered planets for the arrival of the human colonization ships.",
