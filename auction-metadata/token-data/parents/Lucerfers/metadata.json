  "description": "Not all crime happens behind closed doors and in dark alleyways, sometimes crime evolves to bring evil on the streets, often with heavy firepower. That is when you are called in, to rectify what has moved beyond conventional crime. The model is carefully designed with Lucerferium crystals that allow the wearer to deflect bullets in a certain direction, away from civilians and important assets. At the same time, the wearer, with an automatic trigger, shifts into strength mode, which drastically increases the physical capabilities of the user, allowing them to lift cars above their head and shatter the strongest shields and doors. With their immeasurable strength, Lucerfers are a terrible adversary to have.",
