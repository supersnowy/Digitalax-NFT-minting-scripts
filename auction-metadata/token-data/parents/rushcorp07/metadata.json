  "description": "With an undulating poise and charm in her walk, one might expect Destiny to be a fragile and delicate girl. However, most of the people who expected that are now rounded up in jails across the land as Destiny rocks a diverse arsenal of weapons that can knock anyone down with pinpoint accuracy. Trained as an assassin in a prestigious yet undisclosed insititute in her younger years, Destiny has only enhanced her skills over her time as a RUSH agent, making her career record a mark of envy for her peers. Destiny also performs her role as a team leader for many of RUSH Corps' most dangerous missions due to her remarkable performance as a leader, naturally reflected in her royal attire.",
