  "description": "This token is a portal that was just waiting to turn into an NFT. Now your powers have increased. I always loved collecting; from holographic cards that came greasy in snack packages, to video-game tapes, toys, action figures, cups, magazines, phone cardsâ€¦ and I could name more. Oh the 90s! Today I am very excited about Non-Fungible Tokens and designing them to literally carry my traits around as a kind of rich information like DNA. At any time I can organize a collection and make these gems available for other digital hunters. I'm feeling so ready for this!
