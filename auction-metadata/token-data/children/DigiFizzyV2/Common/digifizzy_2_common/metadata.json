  "description": "This outfit stands out for its angular and metallic lines. It's a flashy evening urban style. The jacket is semi-rigid and the trousers are sporty. On the trousers there are two bands that recall the jacket's details. DIGITALAX ran its first open digital fashion competition bringing together amazingly talented creators from across the realms, focused on enabling creatives for modding their version of the metaverse. The content champions of the competition have been included in the DIGIFIZZY content bundles, where buyers will also receive in-game ESPA compatible versions of these skins during the next ESPA esports launch, all hand-crafted in-house through the Global Designer Network.",
