  "description": "Blade Runway is the first Digital Couture Fashion House in Italy. Founded by designers Greta Meacci and Alan Aronica, the project was launched to bring the high quality and know-how of traditional Italian haute couture into the digital world. DIGITALAX ran its first open digital fashion competition bringing together amazingly talented creators from across the realms, focused on enabling creatives for modding their version of the metaverse. The content champions of the competition have been included in the DIGIFIZZY content bundles, where buyers will also receive in-game ESPA compatible versions of these skins during the next ESPA esports launch, all hand-crafted in-house through the Global Designer Network.",
