  "description": "Lumps is a wearable living creature. She was created on a different planet using the natural resources from this planet's environment. Similar to how a plant on earth is an actual living organism, the plants on this planet are alive and possess different capabilities. DIGITALAX ran its first open digital fashion competition bringing together amazingly talented creators from across the realms, focused on enabling creatives for modding their version of the metaverse. The content champions of the competition have been included in the DIGIFIZZY content bundles, where buyers will also receive in-game ESPA compatible versions of these skins during the next ESPA esports launch, all hand-crafted in-house through the Global Designer Network.",
