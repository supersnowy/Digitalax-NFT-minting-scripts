  "description": "The Golden Choker was modelled by Global Designer Network member, Cryptsie. My name is Anna, and I am from Crimea - this is a very beautiful region near the Black Sea, with majestic mountains, green valleys and dense forests. Iâ€™ve been interested in art since childhood, and when I grew up, there was no doubt about who I wanted to become - of course, a designer.",
