  "name": "The Lehenga Choli",
  "description": "The world's first traditional India digital fashion collection is ideated and pioneered by Ravi Singh, a newcomer to digital fashion yet avid supporter of inspiring traditional cultural inclusivity in the industry, 3D modeled by digital fashion designer, Lorena Bello, and animated and rendered by DIGITALAX. The Lehenga Choli is a popular form of Indian women’s dress, which originated in North India during the 10th century and is often worn for weddings or other formal events. The pattern on the skirt is a binary flower, fusing the traditional – a flower – with the futuristic – 0’s and 1’s used in binary codes popularized in the movie the Matrix. The blouse contains a cubed pattern containing Ravi’s initials, RGS, and was sketched by hand by Nureen Wohl, a social worker based in New York City. The headscarf, or the dupatta, contains an intricate piece of forehead jewelry, called a maang tikka.",
