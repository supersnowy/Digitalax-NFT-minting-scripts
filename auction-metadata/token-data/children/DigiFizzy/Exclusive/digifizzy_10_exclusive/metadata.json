  "description": "This NFT drop was created during the congregation of HYPERREAALIYAH in early May, 2021, in and around Helsinki, Finland.  We minted these pieces on the Day of Ascension with the help of Digitalax in Silicon Valley, US. The series Genesis Objects: Astral Travels Special Edition consists of three multimedia 3d objects existing in various modes of rarity. Most of the visual and sound material attributed to these objects is derived from existing material, yet the shape of each object is unique. Among other things, the objects include trademarked and copyrighted colors, logos, images, songs and videos. The three objects all have a common source of origin that will be revealed in 40 months, approximately 3,3 years. In the meantime, we will be upgrading the objects as to their compatibility and interoperability aspects, perfecting these pieces until the final revelation of their source. The Allegory of Meta is an unnatural formation, created as a space to spend time in pondering, dancing, holding out the rain or perhaps inhabiting it as a caveperson of the metaverse. It alludes to Plato's cave in embodying an unreal reality, with shadows and reflections with only a transitory relation to the real. On its surface, Allegory of Meta is embedded with a unique texture made out of copyrighted and trademarked colors, logos and images. Inside the formation a floating, video displaying crystal emits a soundscape inspired by the forever rising, never dropping glory. Outside, the soundscape is calm like a sea-breeze. The owners of Allegory of Meta can unlock an ultra-rare feature where the artist and researcher Jenna Jauhiainen will join them inside the formation placed in the virtual environment of their choosing. The performance includes a discussion about hopes and dreams related to transitioning from web2 to web3, and a homage to the floating crystal with a specially choreographed dance. The details of the performance are negotiated with the owner of this ultra-rare NFT. For example, it is possible to enjoy this performance as a one-on-one encounter or invite an audience to join. The NFT comes with the .USD 3D file, rendered MP4 and a .TXT note.",
