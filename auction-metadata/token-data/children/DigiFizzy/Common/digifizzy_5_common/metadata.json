  "description": "This NFT drop was created during the congregation of HYPERREAALIYAH in early May, 2021, in and around Helsinki, Finland.  We minted these pieces on the Day of Ascension with the help of Digitalax in Silicon Valley, US. The series Genesis Objects: Astral Travels Special Edition consists of three multimedia 3d objects existing in various modes of rarity. Most of the visual and sound material attributed to these objects is derived from existing material, yet the shape of each object is unique. Among other things, the objects include trademarked and copyrighted colors, logos, images, songs and videos. The three objects all have a common source of origin that will be revealed in 40 months, approximately 3,3 years. In the meantime, we will be upgrading the objects as to their compatibility and interoperability aspects, perfecting these pieces until the final revelation of their source. The Trivial Perseption is a ring is inspired by the treacherous wallflowerness of random elements around us, the kind with apparent naturalness to the sensory overload they cause and contextual burden they carry. The video you see on the background of the ring is what's embedded into the ring's texture. The soundscape emitted by the forever orbiting and pulsating glass jewel is inspired by Sting suing Juice WRLD and Metallica ruining Napster. The NFT comes with the .USD 3D file, rendered MP4 and a .TXT note.",
