  "description": "Bred from the roots of the Bay Area's underground soundsystem culture, Singe has been wrecking dancefloors with heavyweight sounds since the glory years of '09. From the speaker-flexing sub frequencies of deep dubstep, to the breakneck assault of drum and bass, the sonic palette Singe has been refining speaks to a new generation of basshead. Filth Merchants draws from extensive sound design techniques, inspired by the music of producers like Kursa, Koan Sound, and Rusko. The track is an ode to heavy electronic bass music pushing new boundaries with a nod to its roots. Dubstep vibes with a halftime spin, a staple of what you can expect from Singe.",
