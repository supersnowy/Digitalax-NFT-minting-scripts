Players use the DIGITALAX digital fashion skins to authenticate their in-game identity and start earning $MONA as they gain winning streaks, going from amateur to pro. Your minecraft ESPA skin was designed in collaboration with DIGITALAX and MC skin artist Cleora. You can take it directly in-game and use it in the upcoming ESPA minecraft casual tournaments.",
