  "description": "WTF is DeFi and why is it so hard to use? What if you could earn more from what you wear? DIGITALAX and the Global Designer Network DAO have partnered with top DeFi protocols creating hybrid digital-physical NFT fashion collections with DeFi functionality. This fashion isnâ€™t just ordinary fashion. It onboards you into an entire world of NFTs, Decentralised Finance, Crypto and Web3. Every fashion piece is a unique NFT that can also earn you yield in $MONA token and other crypto. We are melting the centralised exploitative crown to weave the fabric of a generative ecosystem. Make sure to be signed in on purchase to claim your cap through DRIP and choose between one of many DeFi caps with staking functionality.",
